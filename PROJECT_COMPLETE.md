- 😴 **Sleep** - Very low energy, calming

### 2. **Hybrid Recommendation Algorithm**
```
Final Score = 0.6 × Mood Match + 0.3 × User Taste + 0.1 × Diversity
```

### 3. **ML Models**
- ✅ **Baseline**: Logistic Regression (for comparison)
- ✅ **Main Model**: LightGBM Classifier (high performance)
- ✅ **Features**: 45+ engineered features per mood
- ✅ **Optimization**: Cross-validation + hyperparameter tuning

### 4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**
- F1-Score, ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall
- Precision@K (top-K recommendations)
- Confusion matrices
- ROC curves
- Feature importance analysis

### 5. **Real-Time Recommendations**
